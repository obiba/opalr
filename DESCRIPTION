Description: Data integration Web application for biobanks by 'OBiBa'. 'Opal' is
    the core database application for biobanks. Participant data, once
    collected from any data source, must be integrated and stored in a central
    data repository under a uniform model. 'Opal' is such a central repository.
    It can import, process, validate, query, analyze, report, and export data.
    'Opal' is typically used in a research center to analyze the data acquired at
    assessment centres. Its ultimate purpose is to achieve seamless
    data-sharing among biobanks. This 'Opal' client allows to interact with 'Opal'
    web services and to perform operations on the R server side. 'DataSHIELD'
    administration tools are also provided.
